For years, I was afraid of the Terminal. I was scared that I would erase my entire hard drive with a single typo. üò±

But, then I started using a task runner to compile my Sass (among other things). My world changed forever. I found it to be so much faster and allowed far more task automation than the tools I had been using previously. Anything that will speed up your workflow is worth investing in (whether that‚Äôs time or money).

Once I started spending more time in the Terminal, I became more comfortable and confident. Trust me, I still prefer a good GUI (graphical user interface), but I‚Äôm no longer afraid I‚Äôm going to delete my entire hard drive. ‚Äî And let‚Äôs be honest, you could delete your entire hard drive with a GUI too. Drag your hard drive to the trash and click "Empty Trash." But, nobody in the right their mind would do that. Similarly, you‚Äôd have to type a very specific command in the Terminal to delete your entire hard drive and nobody in their right mind would do that either. ‚Äî Plus if you have a typo in the Terminal, generally, it will you that you have a typo and the command won‚Äôt run.

## Terminal Commands that I‚Äôve Found Helpful

So, here are the commands that I've found to be the most useful.

> Typically when you see commands to run Terminal, you'll see a $ at the beginning of the line. Don‚Äôt copy the $, it signifies that it‚Äôs the beginning of a Terminal line.

### **Changing Directories**

`cd` stands for **change directory.** Similar to the Finder where you click on the folder, in Terminal, you just type in the directory that you want:

```bash
$ cd Sites
```

You can type `cd ..` to go up a level or `cd ../..` to go up 2 levels. `cd /` will take you to your home directory.

The Terminal also supports tab auto-completion. So you could type `cd De<TAB>` and it will fill in `cd Desktop` (assuming that‚Äôs a folder option) for you. Handy!

### **Listing a Folder's Contents**

`ls` will list all files and directories in your current location. If you want to see "hidden" files, or files that start with a period (.) Simply, add a "flag". You can think of a flag as a way of modifying your command or adding preferences. In our case, `ls -la`.

The dash `-` and any letter combination after the dash is called a flag.

If you want also want to see who owns the file and its permissions use `ls -la`.

<Image
  src={lslaImage}
  alt="File listing with the Terminal, include hidden files"
/>

In our output, the weird looking letter combinations on the side, like `drwxr-xr-x` , is a shorthand for that file's/folder's permissions. In this case, everyone can read the directory, but its content can only be changed by the user. If you want to do a deep dive on permissions, you might find [this article from Serverwise](https://blog.ssdnodes.com/blog/linux-permissions/) useful.

`pwd` will show you the file path to your current location. This comes in real handy when you want to run a script from anywhere.

### **Making a New Folder (or Directory)**

`mkdir FOLDERNAME` will **create a folder** named FOLDERNAME. `mkdir` stands for "Make Directory."

> ‚ö° **Power Tip:** Anytime, you hit the up arrow on your keyboard, it will fill in the last command you ran. Hit it again and it will cycle to the command before that. The down arrow cycles in the opposite direction.

Just to give you an idea of how these commands are used together: when I first open the Terminal, I might type `ls` to see what the nested files / folder options are. Then:

```bash
$ cd Code/GIT/
$ mkdir NEWPROJECT
$ cd NEWPROJECT
```

This navigates to the GIT folder and then creates a new directory for a project. Then, navigates inside the folder I just created.

If this is still making your head spin, here‚Äôs a WYSIWYG way that I saved until the end:

- Open up your Terminal type in `cd .`

- Then, open up Finder, navigate to the Folder you want to open in Terminal

- Drag that folder from the Finder onto your Terminal window. It should enter the location for that file path for you.

- Now, hit `<RETURN>`. ‚Äî You‚Äôre welcome.

### Creating a New File

You can create a new file by saying `touch` and then giving the filename:

```jsx
touch.gitignore
```

## A **few other tips and tricks:**

### **Install Warp, Hyper, or iTerm2 as a Terminal Replacement**

If you‚Äôre working on a Mac, ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù comes preinstalled.

- Pull up the **Finder**

- Type `Cmd + Shift + U` and you‚Äôll automatically jump to the Utilities folder

- Inside, you‚Äôll find an application literally called ‚ÄúTerminal‚Äù

This works great if you‚Äôre just getting started, but I actually prefer to use [**Warp**](https://warp.dev). It has a little bit more functionality. Besides, it doesn't hurt that it's **FREE!**

### **Customize the Look and Feel of your Terminal**

I keep it simple and maintain that less is more. However, you can add additional information for each prompt.

For example, you can change the prompt colors, display what git branch you're currently using, the current git state, etc.

[Starship](https://starship.rs/) makes this easy.

<Image src={starshipImage} alt="Starship" />

1. Use a simple brew command to install:

   ```bash
   brew install starship
   ```

2. Add the initialization script to the end of your `./zshrc` file:

   ```bash
   eval "$(starship init zsh)"
   ```

3. Create a configuration file:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config && touch ~/.config/starship.toml
   ```

   Then, all of your [customizations and configurations](https://starship.rs/config/) are done within your TOML file.

Overcoming any fears you might have of the Terminal can lead to significant improvements in productivity and efficiency. While graphical user interfaces have their lace, the Terminal is a powerful alternative, that in practice can increase your productivity and streamline tasks.
